# Decoding-Fastag-Fraud
A Detection Approach By Naveen!

# Statement:
This work aims to harness the power of machine learning classification methods to build a potent fraud detection mechanism for Fastag transactions. The dataset used encompasses crucial attributes like transaction specifics, vehicle data, geographical coordinates, and transaction values. The objective is to construct a sturdy model capable of pinpointing fraudulent activities accurately, thereby safeguarding the integrity and security of Fastag transactions.


# Aim:

The chief goal of this project is to leverage machine learning methodologies to construct a solid fraud detection framework for Fastag transactions. By analyzing key parameters such as transaction details, vehicle data, location, and transaction amounts, the system aspires to accurately detect fraudulent activities, thereby safeguarding the integrity and security of Fastag transactions.
